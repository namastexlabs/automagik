# Simplified Workflow Demo - Progress

## Current Status
Epic initialization complete - ready for workflow execution

## Immediate Next Steps
1. BUILDER workflow will search BRAIN for Felipe's preferences
2. BUILDER will implement authentication applying BRAIN knowledge
3. GUARDIAN will validate using BRAIN quality standards
4. SHIPPER will prepare deployment using BRAIN procedures

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Epic context defined
- [ ] BUILDER implementation
- [ ] GUARDIAN validation
- [ ] SHIPPER deployment prep

## Notes
All complex knowledge (team preferences, patterns, procedures) will be stored in BRAIN, not filesystem.
