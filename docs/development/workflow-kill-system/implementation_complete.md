✅ SUCCESS: Reduced Claude processes from 7 to 3
```

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Stuck workflows terminated
- ✅ System resources freed
- ✅ 4 long-running processes eliminated
- ✅ One process running for 2+ days successfully killed

## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### Emergency Kill Flow
```
1. API Request → /kill endpoint
2. Session Lookup → Find by run_id  
3. Agent Kill → LocalExecutor.cancel_execution()
4. Process Kill → ClaudeCLIExecutor.cancel_execution()
5. Database Update → Mark as killed/terminated
6. Audit Log → Complete event logging
7. Response → Kill confirmation with metrics
```

### Process Tracking Lifecycle
```
1. Process Start → Register in workflow_processes table
2. Execution → Periodic heartbeat updates
3. Monitoring → Stale process detection (5min threshold)
4. Completion → Mark as completed/failed
5. Emergency → Mark as killed/terminated
6. Cleanup → Remove old records (7 days)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow_processes (
    run_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,           -- Unique workflow identifier
    pid INTEGER,                       -- System process ID
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'running',     -- running|completed|failed|killed
    workflow_name TEXT,                -- Builder, Guardian, etc.
    session_id TEXT,                   -- Link to sessions table
    started_at TIMESTAMP,              -- Process start time
    last_heartbeat TIMESTAMP,          -- Last alive confirmation
    process_info JSONB,                -- Command, environment, metadata
    created_at TIMESTAMP,              -- Record creation
    updated_at TIMESTAMP               -- Last update
);
```

### Kill API Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "run_id": "run_5fbae44ab6f0",
  "workflow_name": "builder",
  "killed_at": "2025-06-16T13:33:06Z",
  "kill_method": "graceful",
  "kill_duration_ms": 1250,
  "cleanup_status": {
    "session_updated": true,
    "audit_logged": true,
    "process_terminated": true
  },
  "message": "Workflow builder gracefully terminated in 1.25s"
}
```

## 🛡️ Security & Safety Features

### Felipe's Security Requirements ✅
- **Explicit Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with detailed logging
- **Validation**: Run ID validation, session existence checks
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all kill attempts and outcomes
- **Safe Cleanup**: Graceful shutdown before force kill, resource validation

### Cezar's Architecture Requirements ✅  
- **Clean Separation**: Kill logic isolated from workflow execution
- **Scalable Tracking**: Database-backed process monitoring
- **Robust Recovery**: Multiple kill phases with fallback mechanisms
- **Framework Integration**: Consistent with existing executor patterns

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Emergency Kill via API
```bash
# Graceful termination (recommended)
curl -X POST "/api/v1/workflows/claude-code/run/run_abc123/kill" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_KEY"

# Force kill (emergency only)  
curl -X POST "/api/v1/workflows/claude-code/run/run_abc123/kill?force=true" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_KEY"
```

### Programmatic Kill
```python
from src.agents.claude_code.local_executor import LocalExecutor

executor = LocalExecutor()
success = await executor.cancel_execution("run_abc123")
```

### Process Monitoring
```python
from src.db.repository import get_running_processes, get_stale_processes

# Get all running workflows
running = get_running_processes()

# Find stale processes (no heartbeat >5min)
stale = get_stale_processes(max_age_minutes=5)
```

## 📊 Implementation Metrics

- **Files Modified**: 4 core files
- **Files Created**: 3 new files  
- **Database Migration**: 1 new table + indexes
- **API Endpoints**: 1 new kill endpoint
- **Test Coverage**: Emergency kill test script
- **Success Rate**: 100% on target stuck workflows

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Future)
1. **MCP Integration**: `mcp__automagik_workflows__kill_workflow` tool
2. **Bulk Operations**: Kill multiple workflows by pattern
3. **Timeout Detection**: Automatic kill of workflows exceeding time limits
4. **Resource Monitoring**: CPU/memory-based kill triggers
5. **Notification System**: Alerts for stuck workflow detection

### Guardian Integration
- **Safety Validation**: Pre-kill safety checks
- **Impact Assessment**: Analyze kill consequences  
- **Recovery Planning**: Automated restart procedures
- **Health Monitoring**: Post-kill system health verification
