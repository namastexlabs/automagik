# GENIE + User Workspace TODO System

**Purpose**: Persistent TODO tracking between GENIE and user sessions  
**Location**: `/home/namastex/workspace/am-agents-labs/WORKSPACE_TODOS.md`  
**Usage**: Add items here for cross-session task tracking

## 🚨 URGENT (Do Next)

- [ ] **Investigate claude -p command options** for workflow persona persistence
- [ ] **Implement workflow kill functionality** (mcp__automagik-workflows__kill_workflow) - BUILDER working on it
- [x] **Test BRAIN instances completion** - Phase 1A ✅ COMPLETE, Phase 1B 🚨 STUCK (workflow kill needed) ✅ INVESTIGATED
- [x] **Prepare workflow management documentation** - Test scenarios, safety requirements, monitoring strategy ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY

---

## 📋 MEDIUM PRIORITY

### Platform Enhancements

### Development Workflow
- [ ] **Git workflow optimization** using MCP git tools exclusively
- [ ] **Commit message templates** for workflow-generated commits
- [ ] **Branch management** for parallel workflow development
- [ ] **Testing automation** for workflow changes

---

## 🔬 RESEARCH & INVESTIGATION

### Technical Research
- [ ] **Claude Code CLI documentation review** for prompt persistence options
- [ ] **Session management deep dive** in automagik-workflows
- [ ] **MCP protocol optimization** opportunities
- [ ] **Neo4j/Graphiti integration** enhancement possibilities

### Pattern Analysis
- [ ] **Over-engineering detection patterns** compilation
- [ ] **KISS implementation success metrics** definition
- [ ] **Team preference learning algorithms** improvement
- [ ] **Workflow efficiency benchmarking** system

- [x] **Linear epic draft** - Complete workflow management system epic prepared
- [x] **Wait tool learnings** - Best practices and patterns documented
- [x] **Workspace organization** - Context files created and organized

## ✅ COMPLETED PREVIOUSLY (2025-06-14)

- [x] **KISS workspace optimization implementation** (11 lines, current_workspace=true)
- [x] **LINA workspace test confirmation** (shared workspace working)
- [x] **Direct communication pattern learning** (session ID reuse)
- [x] **BRAIN first test launch** (workspace optimization processing)
- [x] **Parallel BRAIN instances** (3 memory reorganization tasks)
- [x] **Git efficiency learning** (prefer MCP git tools over bash)
- [x] **Linear epic management** (workspace optimization complete)
- [x] **Multi-turn conversation testing** (partial success, persona issues discovered)

## 📝 NOTES & PATTERNS

### Communication Patterns
- **Session Reuse**: Same session_name + new run_id for conversation continuity
- **Persona Issues**: Workflows can lose character identity after 2-3 turns
- **Cache Efficiency**: 68-92% shows technical session continuity works
- **Memory Search**: LINA used mcp__agent-memory__search_memory_facts when prompted

### Efficiency Discoveries  
- **MCP > Bash**: Always prefer MCP tools (git, linear, etc.) over bash commands
- **In-Place Workspace**: 5-10x performance improvement for LINA/BRAIN workflows
- **Parallel Workflows**: Multiple BRAIN instances can reorganize memories simultaneously
- **KISS Validation**: Simple solutions often better than complex orchestration

2. **Test** BRAIN memory reorganization results  
3. **Implement** workflow kill functionality
4. **Design** multi-turn memory persistence testing
5. **Review** and validate workspace optimization benefits
