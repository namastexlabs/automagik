# Epic Overview: release-prep-v0.2.0

## Objective
Prepare the automagik-agents codebase for 0.2 release by cleaning up Claude Code architecture, removing Docker deadcode, consolidating test suite, and renaming project to "automagik".

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- **Claude Code Local-Only Architecture**: Transform from dual-mode (docker/local) to local-only execution
- **Deadcode Removal**: Remove ~1,000+ lines of Docker/container implementation
- **Test Suite Consolidation**: Clean up and optimize test coverage for local execution only
- **Project Rename**: Change from "automagik-agents" to "automagik"
- **Documentation Cleanup**: Establish proper epic documentation standards

### Out of Scope
- **New Claude Code Features**: No new functionality development
- **Breaking API Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility for local execution
- **Performance Optimization**: Beyond what's gained from deadcode removal
- **Docker Implementation**: Explicitly removing, not fixing

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **All local Claude Code functionality preserved** with zero regressions
2. **Complete Docker deadcode removal** (~1,000+ lines)
3. **Test suite passes** with 85%+ coverage maintained
4. **Project successfully renamed** with working installation
5. **Clean documentation structure** following new standards

### Quality Gates
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain minimum 85% coverage
- **Test Performance**: 20%+ improvement in execution time
- **Code Quality**: Reduced cyclomatic complexity
- **Documentation**: Maximum 7 core documents per epic
- **Build Success**: All CI/CD pipelines pass

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Immediate Deadcode Removal (1 day)
- Remove pure Docker files and implementations
- Update .gitignore to prevent future artifacts

### Phase 2: Architecture Simplification (2 days)  
- Simplify agent.py to local-only execution
- Remove/simplify ExecutorFactory pattern
- Update environment variable handling

### Phase 3: Test Suite Consolidation (3 days)
- Remove Docker-specific tests
- Consolidate overlapping test cases
- Enhance local execution coverage

### Phase 4: Project Rename (1 day)
- Update pyproject.toml and package references
- Update documentation and README
- Verify installation and imports

**Total Duration**: 7 days with sequential execution

## Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
- **Development Team**: Implementing the cleanup and rename
- **QA Team**: Validating test coverage and functionality
- **DevOps Team**: CI/CD pipeline updates for rename

### Secondary Stakeholders  
- **Product Team**: Approving project rename decision
- **Documentation Team**: Updating user-facing documentation
- **Community**: Users affected by Docker mode deprecation

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- **Workflow Bug Fix**: Recently completed, provides clean foundation
- **Environment Configuration**: Current .env setup must be preserved
- **Test Infrastructure**: pytest and coverage tools

### Business Dependencies
- **Product Approval**: Project rename requires stakeholder sign-off
- **Release Timeline**: Must complete before 0.2 code freeze
- **User Communication**: Deprecation notices and migration guidance

### External Dependencies
- **Claude CLI**: Local execution dependency (unchanged)
- **Git Operations**: Repository operations (unchanged)
- **File System**: Local workspace management (unchanged)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Hidden Docker Dependencies**: Unknown Docker references that break on removal
- **Test Coverage Drop**: Removing Docker tests might reduce overall coverage
- **User Impact**: Docker users need alternative solutions

### Medium Risk Items
- **Integration Breakage**: Workflow system integration with simplified architecture
- **Performance Regression**: Unexpected impact from architectural changes
- **Documentation Debt**: Ensuring all changes are properly documented

### Low Risk Items
- **Project Rename**: Mostly metadata changes with low technical risk
- **Local Execution**: Well-tested and stable foundation
- **Environment Variables**: Graceful deprecation strategy planned

## Current Status

### Completed (‚úÖ)
- **Workflow Bug Analysis**: Identified and fixed recursive artifact creation
- **Architecture Analysis**: Comprehensive codebase review completed
- **Decision Records**: 7 ADRs documented for major decisions
- **Implementation Planning**: Detailed 4-phase execution plan created

### In Progress (üîÑ)
- **Documentation Consolidation**: Moving from 17 chaotic files to 7 structured documents
- **Risk Mitigation Planning**: Strategies for high-risk removal scenarios

### Pending (‚è≥)
- **Human Approvals**: Project rename and breaking changes management
- **Implementation Execution**: 7-day implementation phase
- **Validation Testing**: Comprehensive testing of cleanup results

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Documentation Consolidation**: Finish organizing epic documentation
2. **Obtain Stakeholder Approvals**: Get sign-off on project rename and deprecation strategy  
3. **Begin Implementation**: Execute Phase 1 (deadcode removal) with validation
4. **Monitor Progress**: Daily checkpoints during 7-day implementation cycle
5. **Validate Results**: Comprehensive testing and quality gate verification

This epic represents a significant architectural cleanup that will improve maintainability, reduce complexity, and establish better development practices for future releases.
