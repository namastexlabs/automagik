## Code Freeze Strategy & Release Architecture

### Phase 1: Quality Gate Implementation (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Code Quality Fixes (Priority: CRITICAL)
```bash
# Fix all critical issues before release
uv run ruff check src/ --fix
uv run ruff format src/
```

**Critical Errors to Fix**:
- **F821 (undefined-name)**: 12 instances - BLOCKING RELEASE
- **E722 (bare-except)**: 11 instances - SECURITY RISK  
- **F401 (unused-import)**: 121 instances - CLEANUP REQUIRED

#### 1.2 Test Suite Stabilization
```bash
# Ensure all tests pass consistently
uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

**Test Requirements**:
- ✅ All 892 tests must pass
- ✅ >85% code coverage maintained
- ✅ No flaky tests
- ✅ Performance benchmarks stable

#### 1.3 Documentation Audit
**Required Documentation**:
- [ ] Public API documentation
- [ ] Installation guides
- [ ] Getting started tutorials
- [ ] Migration guides (if breaking changes approved)
- [ ] Security guidelines
- [ ] Deployment documentation

### Phase 2: Security & Production Readiness (Week 2)

#### 2.1 Security Hardening
**Security Checklist**:
- [ ] Secrets management audit
- [ ] API endpoint security review
- [ ] Database connection security
- [ ] Environment variable validation
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Authentication/authorization review

#### 2.2 Performance Optimization
**Performance Targets**:
- Agent initialization: <2 seconds
- API response time: <500ms (95th percentile)
- Memory usage: <512MB baseline

#### 2.3 Production Configuration
**Configuration Requirements**:
- [ ] Production-ready defaults
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Monitoring and logging
- [ ] Error handling standardization
- [ ] Graceful shutdown procedures

### Phase 3: Breaking Changes Decision & Implementation (Week 3)

#### 3.1 MCP Refactor Decision
**HUMAN APPROVAL REQUIRED** for:
- Database schema migration (mcp_servers → mcp_configs)
- API endpoint changes (15+ endpoints → 4 simplified)
- 2000+ lines of code deletion

**Implementation Options**:
1. **APPROVED**: Implement breaking changes with migration
2. **DEFERRED**: Move breaking changes to v2.0 roadmap
3. **CONDITIONAL**: Implement with specific conditions

#### 3.2 Version Strategy Decision
**Option A: Conservative Release (v1.0 Stable)**
- No breaking changes
- Focus on bug fixes and polish
- Stable API guarantee
- Quick to market

**Option B: Modernized Release (v1.0 with MCP refactor)**
- Include MCP breaking changes
- Better long-term architecture
- Requires migration planning
- Higher risk, higher reward

### Phase 4: Release Candidate & Testing (Week 4)

#### 4.1 Release Candidate Creation
```bash
# Version bump and release candidate
# Update src/version.py: "1.0.0-rc.1"
# Generate changelog
# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.0.0
```

#### 4.2 Integration Testing
**Testing Scenarios**:
- [ ] Fresh installation testing
- [ ] Upgrade testing (v0.1.4 → v1.0.0)
- [ ] Multi-environment testing (Docker, systemd, local)
- [ ] Load testing with multiple agents
- [ ] Integration testing with all supported LLMs

#### 4.3 Community Beta Testing
**Beta Testing Strategy**:
- [ ] Internal team testing (1 week)
- [ ] Trusted partner testing (1 week)
- [ ] Limited public beta (optional)
- [ ] Feedback incorporation

2. **Code Quality Fixes**: Blocks release candidate creation
3. **Documentation**: Blocks beta testing phase

---

**HUMAN APPROVAL REQUIRED**: This release preparation plan requires approval for the MCP breaking changes decision and overall timeline. Please review and provide guidance on:

1. **MCP Refactor Inclusion**: Include in v1.0 or defer to v2.0?
2. **Timeline Approval**: 5-week timeline acceptable?
3. **Resource Allocation**: Team availability for intensive bug fixing?
4. **Risk Tolerance**: Comfort level with identified risks?

The architecture supports both conservative (stable) and modernized (with breaking changes) release approaches based on your decision.
