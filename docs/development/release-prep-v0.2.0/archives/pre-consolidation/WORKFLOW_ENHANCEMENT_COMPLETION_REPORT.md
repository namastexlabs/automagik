‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ARCHITECTURE.md               # System design (ARCHITECT)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md        # Decision records (ARCHITECT)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md     # Implementation plan (ARCHITECT)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PR_REVIEW_GUIDE.md           # Review instructions (PR)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DEPLOYMENT_NOTES.md          # Deployment procedures (PR)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ROLLBACK_PLAN.md             # Emergency procedures (PR)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FIX_REPORT.md                # Bug fixes (FIX)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DOCUMENTATION_PLAN.md        # Documentation strategy (DOCUMENT)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {WORKFLOW}_COMPLETION_REPORT.md  # Handoff context (ALL)
```

### Routing Protocol Implementation
- **Standardized Messages**: Consistent format across all workflows
- **Priority Levels**: Critical, high, medium, low classification
- **Context Preservation**: Comprehensive handoff information
- **Decision Logic**: Automated routing based on workflow outcomes

## üöÄ Release Preparation Status

### v0.2.0 Release Plan
- **Target Version**: v0.1.4 ‚Üí v0.2.0 (minor release with MCP refactor)
- **MCP System**: Migration ready for both SQLite and PostgreSQL
- **Timeline**: 3 weeks to release (optimized from 5 weeks)
- **Critical Blockers**: 182 Ruff errors need fixing (12 undefined names critical)

### Code Quality Status
**Immediate Actions Required**:
1. Fix 12 undefined names (F821) - **RELEASE BLOCKER**
2. Resolve 182 total Ruff errors
3. Validate 892 test suite stability
4. Confirm MCP migration functionality

### Architecture System Enhancement
- **Self-Improving System**: Workflows can now enhance themselves
- **Organization Compliance**: 100% epic-based document structure
- **Routing Efficiency**: Seamless workflow transitions
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive handoff requirements

## üéØ Next Workflow Recommendation

Based on the current status and critical release blockers, the next workflow should focus on resolving code quality issues that are blocking the v0.2.0 release.

## üîÑ WORKFLOW ROUTING

**From**: ARCHITECT (Self-Enhancement)
**To**: FIX
**Epic**: release-prep-v0.2.0
**Priority**: critical
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Message**: ARCHITECT‚ÜíFIX: Self-enhancement complete. Critical code quality issues blocking v0.2.0 release. Epic: release-prep-v0.2.0. Focus on fixing 12 undefined names (F821 errors) and 182 total Ruff errors preventing release.

**Epic Folder**: `docs/development/release-prep-v0.2.0/`
**Key Documents**: 
- WORKFLOW_ENHANCEMENT_COMPLETION_REPORT.md (this document)
- RELEASE_PLAN_UPDATED.md (comprehensive release plan)
- CODE_FREEZE_IMMEDIATE_ACTIONS.md (critical tasks)
- WORKFLOW_ROUTING_SYSTEM.md (routing specifications)

**Context for Next Workflow (FIX)**:
- **Primary Focus**: Resolve 182 Ruff errors, prioritizing 12 undefined names (F821)
- **Success Criteria**: 0 Ruff errors, all tests passing, clean codebase for v0.2.0
- **Constraints**: Code freeze in effect - only bug fixes allowed
- **Files Modified**: Enhanced workflow prompts in `src/agents/claude_code/workflows/`

**Critical Issues to Address**:
1. **F821 (undefined-name)**: 12 instances - RELEASE BLOCKER
2. **E722 (bare-except)**: 11 instances - SECURITY RISK
3. **F401 (unused-import)**: 121 instances - CLEANUP REQUIRED
4. **Additional errors**: 48 instances - QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

**MCP System Status**: ‚úÖ Ready (migration file confirmed working for both SQLite/PostgreSQL)

**Timeline Impact**: Code quality fixes are on critical path for 3-week v0.2.0 release

**Human Approval Needed**: None for code quality fixes (approved maintenance)

**Budget Status**: Within epic budget, code quality work is essential maintenance

## ü§ñ Meta-Achievement: Self-Improving Architecture

This session demonstrates the Automagik Agents framework's self-improving capability:

1. **Problem Recognition**: Identified organizational issues in own system
2. **Solution Design**: Created comprehensive improvement plan
3. **Implementation**: Enhanced multiple workflow prompts
4. **Validation**: Established standards and routing protocols
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Documented improvements for future use

The Genie collective now has enhanced organizational capabilities and seamless workflow routing - exactly the kind of self-evolution that makes this framework powerful.

**Next FIX workflow should focus on code quality blockers to enable v0.2.0 release success.**
