# CODE FREEZE - Immediate Actions Required

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES BLOCKING RELEASE

### Priority 1: Critical Code Quality Fixes (IMMEDIATE)
```bash
# Fix undefined names (BLOCKING RELEASE)
uv run ruff check src/ --select F821 --no-fix
# Manual review and fix required for these 12 undefined names

# Fix bare except clauses (SECURITY RISK)
uv run ruff check src/ --select E722 --no-fix
# Add specific exception types

# Auto-fix what's possible
uv run ruff check src/ --fix
uv run ruff format src/
```

**Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL BLOCKER** - 182 errors, 12 undefined names are release blockers

### Priority 2: MCP Breaking Changes Decision (HUMAN REQUIRED)
**Decision Required**: Include MCP refactor in v1.0 or defer to v2.0?

**Files to Review**:
- `/docs/operations/BREAKING_CHANGES.md` - Full breakdown of impacts
- Current MCP system vs. proposed simplified system

**Impact**: Database migration, API changes, 2000+ lines of code changes

**Timeline Impact**: 
- If APPROVED: +2 weeks for implementation and testing
- If DEFERRED: Can proceed with current timeline

### Priority 3: Test Suite Stabilization (HIGH)
```bash
# Run full test suite to identify failures
uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Run with coverage to ensure we maintain >85%
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

**Status**: 🟡 **892 tests** need to pass consistently

## Week 1 Action Plan

### Day 1-2: Code Quality Sprint
**Team Focus**: Fix all Ruff errors
```bash
# Priority order for fixes:
1. F821 (undefined-name) - 12 instances - CRITICAL
2. E722 (bare-except) - 11 instances - SECURITY
3. F401 (unused-import) - 121 instances - CLEANUP
4. E402 (module-import-not-at-top) - 16 instances
5. F841 (unused-variable) - 9 instances
```

### Day 3: Security Review
- [ ] Audit for hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Review API endpoint security
- [ ] Validate database connection security
- [ ] Check environment variable handling

### Day 4-5: Test Stabilization
- [ ] Run test suite 10 times to identify flaky tests
- [ ] Fix any failing tests
- [ ] Verify performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test database migrations

## Decision Points Requiring Human Approval

### 1. MCP Refactor Decision
**Question**: Include MCP breaking changes in v1.0?
**Options**:
- ✅ **APPROVE**: Include refactor, extend timeline by 2 weeks
- ❌ **DEFER**: Move to v2.0, keep stable v1.0 timeline
- 🔄 **CONDITIONAL**: Approve with specific modifications

### 2. Release Timeline
**Current Plan**: 5 weeks to v1.0 release
**Dependencies**: MCP decision affects timeline
**Question**: Is 5-week timeline acceptable for v1.0?

### 3. Quality Standards
**Current**: 182 Ruff errors, some critical
**Question**: Acceptable to delay release until ALL errors fixed?
**Recommendation**: Yes, undefined names are release blockers

## Communication Plan

### Internal Team
- Daily standup: Code freeze progress
- Weekly review: Release readiness status
- Milestone reviews: Quality gates

### Community
- Code freeze announcement
- Beta testing invitation (when ready)
- Release candidate announcement
- Final release announcement

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk: Code Quality Issues
**Risk**: Bugs in production due to undefined names
**Mitigation**: Fix all critical Ruff errors before proceeding
**Timeline**: 2-3 days intensive work

### Medium Risk: MCP Changes
**Risk**: Breaking changes affect adoption
**Mitigation**: Provide migration guides, gradual rollout
**Timeline**: Depends on approval decision

### Low Risk: Documentation
**Risk**: Poor adoption due to missing docs
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation review
**Timeline**: 1 week parallel work

## Success Metrics for Week 1

### Code Quality
- [ ] 0 Ruff errors (down from 182)
- [ ] 0 undefined names (down from 12)
- [ ] 0 syntax errors (down from 2)

### Testing
- [ ] 100% test pass rate (892/892 tests)
- [ ] >85% code coverage maintained
- [ ] 0 flaky tests identified

### Process
- [ ] MCP decision received from human
- [ ] Release timeline confirmed
- [ ] Quality standards agreed upon
