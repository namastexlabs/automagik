# BRAIN Memory Reorganization - Critical Requirements

## CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The previous Phase 1A and Phase 1B BRAIN runs failed to create comprehensive documentation in the shared workspace. Without proper filesystem collaboration and detailed working files, memory reorganization cannot succeed.

## FILESYSTEM COLLABORATION REQUIREMENTS

### Essential Working Files Needed:
1. **Episode Analysis Files:**
   - `/brain_work/episode_analysis_detailed.md` - Comprehensive episode categorization
   - `/brain_work/episode_timeline_patterns.md` - Temporal relationship mapping
   - `/brain_work/episode_content_quality.md` - Content assessment and consolidation strategy

2. **Fact Network Files:**
   - `/brain_work/fact_network_detailed.md` - Complete fact relationship analysis
   - `/brain_work/relationship_gaps_analysis.md` - Missing/broken relationship identification
   - `/brain_work/group_migration_strategy.json` - Detailed reorganization plan

3. **Pattern Extraction Files:**
   - `/brain_work/agent_architecture_patterns.md` - Architecture implementation patterns
   - `/brain_work/multimodal_patterns.md` - Multimodal implementation strategies
   - `/brain_work/debugging_patterns.md` - Error resolution and prevention patterns
   - `/brain_work/workflow_optimization_patterns.md` - GENIE and orchestration patterns

4. **Migration Strategy Files:**
   - `/brain_work/memory_migration_plan.json` - Structured migration approach
   - `/brain_work/new_group_structure.json` - Target organization structure
   - `/brain_work/consolidation_targets.md` - Duplicate removal strategy

## DATA AVAILABLE FOR REORGANIZATION

### Episodes Export: 
- File: `/brain_work/current_episodes_full_export.json`
- Contains: 25+ episodes with categorization and content analysis
- Ready for: BRAIN pattern extraction and organization planning

### Facts Export:
- File: `/brain_work/current_facts_full_export.json` 
- Contains: 50+ relationship facts with detailed metadata
- Ready for: Relationship mapping and gap analysis

### Current Status:
- âœ… Raw data exported to workspace
- âœ… Working directory structure created
- ðŸš¨ BRAIN instances must create comprehensive documentation files
- ðŸš¨ No BRAIN instance should complete without creating workspace files

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Restart BRAIN workflows with explicit filesystem requirements**
2. **Mandate creation of working files for collaboration**
3. **Require 25+ turns for genuine comprehensive analysis**
4. **Validate working files exist before marking tasks complete**

## WORKFLOW KILL REQUIREMENT

The stuck BRAIN workflow (run_42a1cba16b84) demonstrates urgent need for:
- `mcp__automagik-workflows__kill_workflow(run_id)` functionality
- Workflow monitoring and intervention capabilities
- Prevention of infinite stuck states

**Status**: Memory reorganization cannot proceed without proper BRAIN filesystem collaboration.
