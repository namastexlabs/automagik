# Epic Overview: Model Selection & Virtual Agents Architecture

## Objective

Design and architect two critical improvements to the Automagik Agents platform:
1. **Clean Model Selection**: Simplify model selection to ideally just a line in the agent definition
2. **Virtual Agents System**: Create a database-driven virtual agents architecture where agents load configurations from DB

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope:
- Model selection architecture simplification and enhancement
- Virtual agents database schema design and implementation plan
- Backward compatibility considerations and migration strategies
- Breaking change analysis and risk mitigation
- Integration with existing AutomagikAgent framework

### Out of Scope:
- Actual implementation code changes (ARCHITECT workflow boundary)
- Deployment and DevOps considerations
- UI/frontend development for agent management
- Performance optimization beyond architectural recommendations

## Success Criteria

1. **Model Selection Simplification**:
   - Single-line model configuration in agent definitions
   - Automatic model capability detection and switching
   - Unified model configuration across all agent types
   - Backward compatibility with existing config-based approach

2. **Virtual Agents Architecture**:
   - Database-driven agent configuration storage
   - Dynamic agent creation without code changes
   - Individual endpoints for each virtual agent
   - Runtime configuration updates capability
   - Template-based agent creation system

3. **Production Safety**:
   - Zero-downtime migration path identified
   - Breaking changes documented with mitigation strategies
   - Security implications assessed and addressed
   - Performance impact analyzed and optimized

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Architecture design and documentation (current phase)
- **Week 3-4**: Implementation planning and migration strategy
- **Week 5-6**: Core infrastructure development
- **Week 7-8**: Advanced features and management interface

## Stakeholders

- **Primary**: Development team implementing AutomagikAgent improvements
- **Secondary**: DevOps team for deployment considerations
- **Reviewing**: Security team for virtual agents access control
- **Users**: Agent developers wanting simplified model selection

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies:
- Existing AutomagikAgent framework and PydanticAI integration
- SQLite database schema and migration capabilities
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server infrastructure
- Linear API integration for project management

### Architectural Dependencies:
- Recent AutomagikAgent refactor completion
- Understanding of current model selection pain points
- Database schema evolution capabilities
- API versioning and backward compatibility requirements

## Key Architectural Decisions

This epic involves several critical architectural decisions:
1. Model descriptor pattern vs. configuration-based selection
2. Virtual agent factory design and instantiation strategy
3. Database schema normalization vs. JSON configuration storage
4. API endpoint routing for dynamic virtual agents
5. Security and permission model for virtual agent access

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks:
- Breaking changes in model selection patterns requiring widespread code updates
- Database schema migrations with potential data loss
- Performance implications of dynamic configuration loading
- Security vulnerabilities in virtual agent configuration system

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Phased implementation with feature flags
- Comprehensive backup and rollback procedures
- Extensive testing on non-production environments
- Security review of virtual agent access patterns
