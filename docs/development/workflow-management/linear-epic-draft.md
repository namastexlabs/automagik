# Linear Epic: Comprehensive Workflow Management System

## Epic Title
ðŸ”„ Workflow Management System: Kill, Restart, and Monitoring

## Epic Description

Implement a comprehensive workflow management system that provides full lifecycle control over Claude Code workflows. This system will enable users to kill stuck workflows, restart failed ones, and monitor execution in real-time, significantly improving the reliability and usability of our autonomous agent platform.

### Problem Statement

Currently, workflows can become stuck or fail without clear remediation paths. Users lack visibility into workflow status and cannot intervene when issues arise. This leads to:
- Wasted compute resources on stuck workflows
- Inability to stop runaway processes
- No recovery mechanism for transient failures
- Limited debugging capabilities
- Poor user experience during failures

### Solution Overview

Build a robust workflow management system with three core capabilities:

1. **Kill Functionality**: Safe, controlled termination of workflows
2. **Restart Capability**: Intelligent restart with state preservation
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Comprehensive visibility and alerting

### Success Criteria

- âœ… Any workflow can be safely terminated within 10 seconds
- âœ… Failed workflows can be restarted from checkpoints
- âœ… Real-time status visible in Slack and web dashboard
- âœ… 99% kill success rate
- âœ… Zero data loss during termination
- âœ… Automated monitoring with intelligent alerts
