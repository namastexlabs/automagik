# Workflow Termination Safety Requirements

## Overview

This document defines safety requirements and constraints for workflow termination to ensure system stability, data integrity, and graceful handling of all termination scenarios.

## Core Safety Principles

### 1. No Data Loss
- All in-flight data must be persisted or safely discarded
- Database transactions must complete or rollback
- File operations must be atomic
- Git operations must maintain repository integrity

### 2. Resource Cleanup
- All allocated resources must be released
- No orphaned processes or threads
- Temporary files must be deleted
- Network connections must be closed
- Memory must be freed

### 3. State Consistency
- Workflow state must be accurately reflected
- No partially completed operations
- Clear audit trail of termination
- Dependent workflows notified

## Termination Phases

### Phase 1: Graceful Shutdown (0-5 seconds)
```
1. Receive termination signal
2. Stop accepting new work
3. Complete current atomic operation
4. Save progress/checkpoint
5. Close external connections
6. Update status to "terminating"
```

### Phase 2: Forced Shutdown (5-10 seconds)
```
1. Cancel ongoing operations
2. Force close connections
3. Kill child processes
4. Emergency state save
5. Update status to "terminated"
```

### Phase 3: System Kill (10+ seconds)
```
1. OS-level process termination
2. Cleanup by parent process
3. Mark as "killed" in database
4. Trigger cleanup jobs
```

## Critical Sections

### Git Operations
- **Protected Operations**:
  - Git commit (must complete)
  - Git push (must complete or rollback)
  - Branch operations (must complete)
- **Safety Mechanism**: 30-second grace period for git operations
- **Rollback Strategy**: Reset to last known good state

### Database Transactions
- **Protected Operations**:
  - Multi-row updates
  - Schema migrations
  - Batch inserts
- **Safety Mechanism**: Transaction boundaries respected
- **Rollback Strategy**: Automatic transaction rollback

### File System Operations
- **Protected Operations**:
  - Large file writes
  - Directory restructuring
  - Archive creation
- **Safety Mechanism**: Atomic file operations
- **Rollback Strategy**: Temporary file cleanup

### External API Calls
- **Protected Operations**:
  - Payment processing
  - Third-party integrations
  - Webhook deliveries
- **Safety Mechanism**: Idempotency keys
- **Rollback Strategy**: Compensation transactions

## Permission Model

### Who Can Kill
1. **Workflow Owner**: Full kill permissions
2. **System Admin**: Full kill permissions
3. **Team Lead**: Kill permissions for team workflows
4. **Automated Systems**: Kill based on policies

### Who Cannot Kill
1. **Read-only users**: No kill permissions
2. **External users**: No kill permissions
3. **Workflows themselves**: Cannot self-terminate (must request)

## Safety Checks

### Pre-Kill Validation
```python
def can_kill_workflow(workflow_id, user_id):
    # Check workflow exists
    if not workflow_exists(workflow_id):
        return False, "Workflow not found"
    
    # Check permissions
    if not has_kill_permission(user_id, workflow_id):
        return False, "Insufficient permissions"
    
    # Check workflow state
    if workflow_state in ["completed", "failed", "terminated"]:
        return False, "Cannot kill finished workflow"
    
    # Check critical section
    if in_critical_section(workflow_id):
        return False, "Workflow in critical section"
    
    return True, "OK"
```

### Kill Safety Wrapper
```python
def safe_kill_workflow(workflow_id, force=False):
    try:
        # Phase 1: Graceful
        signal_termination(workflow_id)
        wait_for_completion(timeout=5)
        
        # Phase 2: Forced
        if still_running(workflow_id) and force:
            force_terminate(workflow_id)
            wait_for_completion(timeout=5)
        
        # Phase 3: System
        if still_running(workflow_id):
            system_kill(workflow_id)
            
    finally:
        # Always cleanup
        cleanup_resources(workflow_id)
        update_status(workflow_id, "terminated")
        notify_stakeholders(workflow_id)
```

## Monitoring Requirements

### Real-time Monitoring
- Kill command latency
- Termination success rate
- Resource cleanup time
- Orphaned process detection

### Alerting Thresholds
- Failed kills > 1%: Warning
- Failed kills > 5%: Critical
- Cleanup time > 60s: Warning
- Orphaned processes > 0: Critical

### Audit Requirements
- All kill attempts logged
- User identity recorded
- Timestamp precision to milliseconds
- Reason for termination captured
- Final state recorded

## Recovery Procedures

### Failed Kill Recovery
1. Identify stuck workflow
2. Analyze root cause
3. Manual intervention if needed
4. System-level cleanup
5. Post-mortem analysis

### Data Recovery
1. Identify last checkpoint
2. Restore from backup
3. Replay from audit log
4. Validate data integrity
5. Resume or restart workflow

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Permission validation
- State machine transitions
- Resource cleanup
- Error handling

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end kill scenarios
- Multi-workflow dependencies
- External system integration
- Performance under load

### Chaos Testing
- Random kill injection
- Network partition during kill
- Storage failure during kill
- System crash during kill

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Retention
- Killed workflow data retained per policy
- Audit logs immutable
- PII handling during cleanup

### Security
- Kill commands authenticated
- Authorization checks enforced
- Audit trail tamper-proof
- No privilege escalation

### Performance
- Kill operations non-blocking
- Minimal system impact
- Scalable to 1000s of workflows
- Sub-second response time
