# Workflow Kill Functionality Test Scenarios

## Overview

This document outlines comprehensive test scenarios for the workflow kill functionality implemented in the BUILDER workflow. These scenarios ensure safe, reliable, and controlled workflow termination.

## Core Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Kill Operations

#### Scenario 1.1: Kill Running Workflow
- **Setup**: Start a long-running workflow (e.g., TESTER with 30+ minute test suite)
- **Action**: Issue kill command via Slack or API
- **Expected**: 
  - Workflow terminates within 5 seconds
  - Status updates to "terminated"
  - Cleanup operations complete
  - Resources released

#### Scenario 1.2: Kill Pending Workflow
- **Setup**: Queue multiple workflows, identify one in pending state
- **Action**: Kill the pending workflow
- **Expected**: 
  - Workflow removed from queue
  - Never enters running state
  - Status shows "cancelled"

#### Scenario 1.3: Kill Completed Workflow
- **Setup**: Attempt to kill already completed workflow
- **Action**: Issue kill command
- **Expected**: 
  - Error message: "Cannot kill completed workflow"
  - No state changes
  - Audit log entry created

### 2. Edge Cases

#### Scenario 2.1: Kill During Critical Operation
- **Setup**: Kill workflow during git commit/push
- **Action**: Time kill during active git operation
- **Expected**: 
  - Git operation completes or rolls back cleanly
  - No partial commits
  - Repository state remains consistent

#### Scenario 2.2: Kill Stuck Workflow
- **Setup**: Simulate stuck workflow (infinite loop, deadlock)
- **Action**: Issue kill command
- **Expected**: 
  - Force termination after grace period
  - Process cleanup
  - Error diagnostics captured

#### Scenario 2.3: Rapid Kill Commands
- **Setup**: Issue multiple kill commands rapidly
- **Action**: Send 10 kill commands within 1 second
- **Expected**: 
  - First command processes
  - Subsequent commands ignored with "already terminating" message
  - No race conditions

### 3. Integration Tests

#### Scenario 3.1: Kill from Slack
- **Setup**: Running workflow with Slack integration
- **Action**: Use Slack slash command to kill
- **Expected**: 
  - Immediate acknowledgment in Slack
  - Status updates in thread
  - Final termination confirmation

#### Scenario 3.2: Kill via API
- **Setup**: Running workflow accessible via API
- **Action**: POST to /workflows/{id}/kill endpoint
- **Expected**: 
  - 200 OK response
  - JSON status update
  - Webhook notifications sent

#### Scenario 3.3: Kill with Active MCP Sessions
- **Setup**: Workflow with active MCP tool connections
- **Action**: Kill workflow
- **Expected**: 
  - All MCP sessions closed gracefully
  - No orphaned processes
  - Connection pools cleaned up

### 4. Safety Tests

#### Scenario 4.1: Permission Checks
- **Setup**: Attempt kill from unauthorized user
- **Action**: Non-owner tries to kill workflow
- **Expected**: 
  - 403 Forbidden response
  - No state change
  - Security audit log entry

#### Scenario 4.2: Data Integrity
- **Setup**: Kill during data write operation
- **Action**: Time kill during database transaction
- **Expected**: 
  - Transaction rolls back cleanly
  - No partial writes
  - Data consistency maintained

#### Scenario 4.3: Resource Cleanup
- **Setup**: Kill workflow using temporary files/resources
- **Action**: Kill and verify cleanup
- **Expected**: 
  - All temp files deleted
  - Memory released
  - No resource leaks

## Validation Checklist

### Pre-Kill Validations
- [ ] Workflow exists and is killable
- [ ] User has permission to kill
- [ ] Workflow not in critical section
- [ ] Kill command properly formatted

### During Kill
- [ ] Grace period honored (5s default)
- [ ] Status updates propagated
- [ ] Child processes terminated
- [ ] Active operations cancelled/rolled back

### Post-Kill
- [ ] Final status correctly set
- [ ] All resources released
- [ ] Audit trail complete
- [ ] Notifications sent
- [ ] No zombie processes

## Performance Requirements

- Kill acknowledgment: < 100ms
- Graceful termination: < 5s
- Force termination: < 10s
- Resource cleanup: < 30s
- Status propagation: < 1s

## Error Scenarios

### Network Failures
- Kill command during network partition
- Expected: Local termination, eventual consistency

### Storage Failures
- Kill during disk full condition
- Expected: In-memory status update, best-effort logging

### System Failures
- Kill during system shutdown
- Expected: Handled by OS signal handlers

## Monitoring & Alerts

- Kill success rate > 99%
- Average kill time < 3s
- Resource leak detection
- Orphaned process alerts
- Failed cleanup notifications
