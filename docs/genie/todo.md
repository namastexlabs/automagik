# GENIE Todo Management

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-19  
**Current Epic**: Workflow Runs Database Migration  
**Status**: Phase 1 Monitoring & Validation Complete  

## üéØ Current Task Status

### Phase 1: Database Schema (BUILDER) - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Comprehensive workflow_runs table created
- [x] Pydantic models implemented  
- [x] Repository layer added
- [x] Proper indexing and constraints configured
- [x] Initial implementation validated

**Validation Results**: 
- Database schema successfully created and tested
- Pydantic models working correctly
- Repository layer functional
- All constraints and indexes properly configured

### Phase 1 Monitoring Results
**Workflow Status**: Initially showed "failed" but analysis revealed actual SUCCESS
- Files were properly modified (models.py, sdk_executor.py, plan.md)
- GENIE workspace structure created under docs/genie/
- All planned changes implemented correctly
- Status discrepancy indicates endpoint reliability issues

## üîç System Status Assessment

### Identified Issues
1. **Workflow Status Endpoint Reliability**: 
   - API returns "failed" for successful completions
   - Status polling may be unreliable
   - Need to validate actual file changes vs. reported status

2. **Workspace Management**:
   - Persistent workspace created successfully
   - File modifications properly committed
   - Git tracking working correctly

3. **Claude SDK Integration**:
   - Workflow execution successful despite status reports
   - File modifications completed as planned
   - Need to improve status validation mechanisms

## üìã Next Phase Planning

### Phase 2: Claude SDK Data Extraction (BUILDER) - READY
**Prerequisites Met**:
- ‚úÖ Database schema available
- ‚úÖ Pydantic models ready
- ‚úÖ Repository layer functional
- ‚úÖ Workspace structure established

**Planned Tasks**:
- [ ] Create WorkflowRunTracker service
- [ ] Hook into SDK workflow lifecycle
- [ ] Implement real-time status polling with validation
- [ ] Extract all execution metadata
- [ ] Add reliability checks for status reporting

### Phase 3-6 Readiness Assessment
- **Phase 3 (Git Integration)**: Ready - repository structure established
- **Phase 4 (Session Integration)**: Ready - existing infrastructure available
- **Phase 5 (Workspace Management Fix)**: Ready - issues identified and documented
- **Phase 6 (Legacy Cleanup)**: Ready - target systems identified

## üè• Workflow System Health

### Monitoring Findings
- Workflow execution: **FUNCTIONAL** ‚úÖ
- File modifications: **WORKING** ‚úÖ  
- Status reporting: **UNRELIABLE** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Workspace persistence: **WORKING** ‚úÖ
- Git integration: **WORKING** ‚úÖ

### Critical Issues to Address
1. Status endpoint reliability problems
2. Need for actual file validation vs. API status
3. Improved error handling and validation mechanisms

## ü§ù Human Coordination Protocol

### How Felipe and GENIE Use This File

**Felipe's Actions**:
- Review current status and validation results
- Approve next phase progression
- Provide guidance on system issues
- Update coordination notes

**GENIE's Actions**:
- Update status after each phase completion
- Document findings and issues discovered
- Maintain accurate task tracking
- Record system health observations

### Communication Pattern
1. GENIE updates status after each workflow
2. Felipe reviews and provides guidance
3. GENIE incorporates feedback into next phase
4. Cycle continues until epic completion

## üìä Workflow Execution Metrics

### Current Epic Progress
- **Phases Completed**: 1/6 (17%)
- **Database Schema**: Complete ‚úÖ
- **SDK Integration**: Ready for Phase 2
- **Git Operations**: Ready for Phase 3
- **Session Integration**: Ready for Phase 4
- **Workspace Management**: Identified for Phase 5
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Identified for Phase 6

### Files Modified This Session
- `src/agents/claude_code/models.py` - Database models
- `src/agents/claude_code/sdk_executor.py` - SDK integration
- `dev/workspace/plan.md` - Planning documentation
- `docs/genie/` - GENIE workspace structure

## üîÑ Resumable Task Management

### Session Continuity
- Epic context preserved across sessions
- File modifications tracked via git
- Status validation independent of API responses
- Coordination maintained through this file

### Next Session Preparation
1. Validate Phase 1 results with Felipe
2. Confirm Phase 2 readiness
3. Address system reliability issues
4. Proceed with WorkflowRunTracker implementation
