# Architecture Decision Framework

## Overview

This document establishes a systematic approach for making, documenting, and tracking architectural decisions in the Automagik Agents framework. It provides templates, processes, and guidelines for ensuring decisions are well-reasoned, documented, and reviewable.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Process

### What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams understand the reasoning behind architectural choices and maintain consistency over time.

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for decisions that:
- Affect the overall system architecture
- Have significant cost or complexity implications
- Impact multiple components or teams
- Establish patterns for future development
- Involve trade-offs between alternatives
- Have long-term consequences
- Require stakeholder alignment

## Risk Assessment Methodology

### Risk Categories

#### Technical Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Will this affect system performance?
- **Scalability Concerns**: How will this handle growth?
- **Security Implications**: What security risks are introduced?
- **Complexity**: How much complexity does this add?
- **Maintainability**: Will this be difficult to maintain?

#### Business Risks
- **Cost Impact**: What are the financial implications?
- **Timeline Risk**: Could this delay delivery?
- **Resource Requirements**: What skills/people are needed?
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Does this create dependencies?
- **Compliance**: Are there regulatory implications?

#### Operational Risks
- **Deployment Complexity**: How difficult is deployment?
- **Monitoring**: Can we observe this effectively?
- **Disaster Recovery**: How does this affect recovery?
- **Support**: Can the team support this?

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Probability | Impact | Risk Level | Action Required |
|-------------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| High | High | Critical | Must mitigate before proceeding |
| High | Medium | High | Develop mitigation plan |
| Medium | High | High | Develop mitigation plan |
| Medium | Medium | Medium | Monitor and have contingency |
| Low | High | Medium | Monitor and have contingency |
| High | Low | Low | Accept risk |
| Medium | Low | Low | Accept risk |
| Low | Medium | Low | Accept risk |
| Low | Low | Minimal | Accept risk |

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Avoidance
- Choose alternative approach that eliminates the risk
- Delay decision until more information is available
- Change requirements to remove risk source

#### Mitigation
- Implement safeguards to reduce probability
- Add monitoring to detect issues early
- Create fallback options
- Phase implementation to limit impact

#### Transfer
- Use external services to shift risk
- Implement insurance or SLAs
- Share risk with partners

#### Acceptance
- Acknowledge risk and monitor
- Prepare response plans
- Set risk tolerance thresholds

8. **Communication**: Share decision with affected teams

### Review Process
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Assess all active ADRs
- **Triggered Reviews**: When circumstances change significantly
- **Post-Implementation Reviews**: 3-6 months after implementation
- **Annual Archive**: Move deprecated ADRs to archive

### Status Transitions
```

## Examples

### Sample ADR: Agent Communication Protocol

```markdown
# ADR-001: Agent Communication Protocol

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Author**: Architecture Team

## Context
Need standardized communication between AI agents in orchestration workflows.

## Decision
Implement MCP (Model Context Protocol) for agent-to-agent communication.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Direct HTTP calls**: Simple but lacks standardization
2. **Message queue**: Scalable but adds complexity
3. **MCP Protocol**: Standardized but newer technology

## Rationale
MCP provides standardized tool discovery and execution patterns that align with our multi-agent architecture goals.
