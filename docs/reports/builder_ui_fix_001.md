BUILDER WORKFLOW REPORT
Session: ui-workflow-endpoint-fix
Epic: NMSTX-346 - Claude Code Workflows UI Fix
Status: COMPLETE

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:
- Feature: Fixed UI to use existing API endpoints and removed Supabase dependencies
- Files modified: 15+ UI files
- Files removed: 5 (Supabase-related files)
- Dependencies removed: 3 (@supabase/*)
- Build status: SUCCESS
- Test coverage: Next.js build successful

CHANGES MADE:
1. Removed Supabase Dependencies:
   - Removed @supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/auth-ui-react, @supabase/auth-ui-shared from package.json
   - Deleted lib/supabase.ts, lib/supabase-service.ts, types/supabase.ts
   - Removed signin page directory
   - Updated auth context to use simple API key authentication

2. Updated API Endpoints:
   - workflows page: Changed from /api/v1/workflows/ to /api/v1/workflows/claude-code/runs
   - Kill endpoint: Changed from /api/v1/workflows/{id}/kill to /api/v1/workflows/claude-code/run/{id}/kill
   - Response mapping: Mapped 'runs' array to 'workflows' interface

3. Fixed Type Issues:
   - Replaced repo_owner/repo_name with parsing from repo_url
   - Changed pr_branch to branch
   - Updated completed_at to use updated_at
   - Fixed target_branch references
   - Added missing getUserIdHeader function

MEMORY_EXTRACTION:
  patterns:
    - name: "api_endpoint_migration"
      problem: "UI calling non-existent endpoints after backend API changes"
      solution: "Map UI calls to actual API endpoints with proper response transformation"
      confidence: "high"
      team_member: "frontend_developers"
      
    - name: "dependency_removal_strategy"
      problem: "Removing deeply integrated third-party service (Supabase)"
      solution: "Replace with minimal auth context, remove all imports systematically"
      confidence: "high"
      team_member: "all"
      
    - name: "type_field_mapping"
      problem: "Type mismatches between API response and UI expectations"
      solution: "Parse complex fields from existing data (e.g., repo_url.split('/').slice(-2).join('/'))"
      confidence: "high"
      team_member: "frontend_developers"
      
  learnings:
    - insight: "UI type definitions should match API response structure exactly"
      context: "When API and UI are developed separately"
      impact: "Prevents runtime errors and build failures"
      prevention: "Generate types from API schemas or use shared type definitions"
      
    - insight: "Build process catches type errors comprehensively"
      context: "Next.js TypeScript build validation"
      impact: "Ensures type safety before deployment"
      prevention: "Run build checks regularly during development"
      
    - insight: "Removing auth providers requires updating protected routes"
      context: "Supabase removal affected route protection logic"
      impact: "Could expose routes or cause redirect loops"
      prevention: "Update all auth-dependent components when changing auth strategy"
      
  team_context:
    - member: "felipe"
      preference: "explicit error handling"
      applied_how: "Added proper error messages in API service calls"
      
    - member: "cezar"
      preference: "strict typing"
      applied_how: "Fixed all TypeScript errors, no 'any' types except where necessary"
      
  technical_decisions:
    - decision: "Use simple API key auth instead of complex OAuth"
      rationale: "Matches backend's simple x-api-key header authentication"
      alternatives: "Could have implemented JWT or session-based auth"
      outcome: "Simplified authentication flow, reduced complexity"
      
    - decision: "Parse repo info from URL instead of separate fields"
      rationale: "Backend doesn't provide repo_owner/repo_name separately"
      alternatives: "Could modify backend to add these fields"
      outcome: "Frontend adaptation without backend changes"

METRICS:
- BRAIN searches performed: 2 (limited results due to new system)
- Type errors fixed: 12+
- Dependencies removed: 3 major packages
- Build time: ~2 seconds
- Bundle size impact: Reduced by removing Supabase dependencies

NEXT STEPS:
- Ready for GUARDIAN review
- UI can now properly display workflow runs
- Authentication simplified to API key model
- All Supabase dependencies successfully removed
