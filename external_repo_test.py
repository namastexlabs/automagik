External Repository Integration Test
====================================

This file tests the external repository integration with the new branch naming structure.

Test: NMSTX-500 - Verify external repository integration with branch naming
Branch: feat/NMSTX-500-test-feature-builder
Date: 2025-01-20

Purpose:
- Verify that the branch naming structure (NMSTX-XX-feature-name) works correctly
- Test external repository integration capabilities
- Ensure workflow system can work with external repos

Expected Behavior:
- File can be created and committed on feature branch
- Branch follows Linear task naming convention
- External repo operations work as expected
