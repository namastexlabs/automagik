# Workflow Bug Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-06-20

### Fixed Issues

1. **Subprocess Python Environment** ✅
   - File: `src/agents/claude_code/execution_isolator.py`
   - Fix: Now uses virtual environment Python explicitly
   - Status: APPLIED and WORKING

2. **Workspace Path Storage** ✅ (Code added but not working)
   - File: `src/agents/claude_code/agent.py`
   - Fix: Added code to update workflow run with workspace path
   - Status: CODE ADDED but workspace_path still NULL in database
   - Issue: The update is happening but may be failing silently

### Remaining Issues

1. **Workspace Path Still NULL**
   - Despite adding the update code, workspace_path remains NULL
   - Need to investigate why the update is failing
   - Possible issues:
     - Database connection/transaction issues
     - Timing issue (update happening before record exists)
     - Import or module issue

2. **Status Reporting** 
   - Not yet fixed - need to locate and update the status endpoint
   - Should use `workflow_run.status == "completed"` instead of phase

3. **Workspace Key Mismatch**
   - Not yet addressed
   - Workspaces stored with run_id but retrieved with claude_session_id

4. **Stuck Workflows**
   - Two workflows (ee2630fb and 9cb7e8a9) still marked as "running"
   - Need cleanup mechanism

### Cleanup Done

1. Moved all investigation documents to `/genie/archived_investigations/`
2. Removed test Python files from `/genie/`
3. Consolidated bug reports for future reference

### Next Steps

1. Debug why workspace_path update is failing
2. Fix status reporting endpoint
3. Address workspace key mismatch
4. Clean up stuck workflows
5. Add integration tests to prevent regression
