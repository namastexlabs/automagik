# Genie Validation Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Setup & Preparation
1. Create test task cards for different workflow types
2. Establish baseline metrics for comparison
3. Document current genie.md specifications

## Phase 2: Workflow Testing
Execute test scenarios with different workflows:

### CLAUDE Test (Research & Analysis)
- Simple research task
- Documentation generation
- Task card update verification

### BUILDER Test (Implementation)
- Code generation task
- Multi-requirement implementation
- Progress tracking through checkboxes

### Combined Test (Multi-Workflow)
- Sequential workflow coordination
- Session management validation
- Progress monitoring across workflows

## Phase 3: Monitoring & Analysis
1. Test workflow status tool effectiveness
2. Compare task card reading vs status API
3. Measure wait timing accuracy
4. Document progress detection patterns

## Phase 4: Issue Investigation
Focus on known problems:
- Task card merge-back limitation
- Real-time status awareness
- Verbosity optimization
- Subworkflow instruction clarity

## Phase 5: Report Generation
Compile comprehensive findings:
- What works well
- What doesn't work
- Identified flaws
- Optimization recommendations
- Subworkflow improvement guidance

## Timeline
- Phase 1-2: Initial testing (10 minutes)
- Phase 3-4: Monitoring and analysis (10 minutes)
- Phase 5: Report compilation (5 minutes)

Total estimated time: 25 minutes
