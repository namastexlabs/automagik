# üîç CRITICAL WORKFLOW BUG INVESTIGATION REPORT

**Date:** 2025-06-20  
**Investigator:** GENIE  
**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL  

## üö® Executive Summary

The workflow system has critical issues preventing proper execution:
1. **No worktree folders are being created for new sessions**
2. **Workspace path is None during workflow execution**
3. **Only 2 persistent folders exist** in `/worktrees/`: `builder_persistent` and `surgeon_persistent`
4. **The `/tmp/am-agent-labs/` directory doesn't exist**

## üìä Investigation Details

### Test Workflow Execution
- **Run ID:** a1ddb1a4-bef7-43ab-9cd5-80fde34d7a62
- **Workflow:** surgeon
- **Session:** bug_investigation_test_001
- **Status:** Completed but with failures
- **Duration:** 22 seconds
- **Result:** Workflow completed but couldn't find workspace path

### Key Log Findings

```
AUTO-COMMIT: Workspace path for run_id=a1ddb1a4-bef7-43ab-9cd5-80fde34d7a62, claude_session_id=2784a24b-0f53-47ed-8232-a3a2fd87db4e: None
AUTO-COMMIT: ‚ö†Ô∏è No workspace path found for run a1ddb1a4-bef7-43ab-9cd5-80fde34d7a62
```

### Directory Structure Analysis

1. **Worktrees Directory (`/home/namastex/workspace/am-agents-labs/worktrees/`)**:
   - Only contains: `builder_persistent/` and `surgeon_persistent/`
   - No session-specific directories being created
   - No temporary worktree folders

2. **Missing Directories**:
   - `/tmp/am-agent-labs/` doesn't exist
   - No session-specific worktree folders are created

### Database Analysis

The workflow_runs table shows:
- Session ID: 30ce115b-b320-4f50-a793-4b62600d7c65
- Workspace path: NULL
- Workspace persistent: 1
- Status: completed (but with issues)

## üî¥ Root Cause Hypothesis

1. **CLIEnvironmentManager Issue**: The environment manager is initialized with base path `/home/namastex/workspace/am-agents-labs/worktrees` but fails to create new worktree directories

2. **Session Workspace Creation Failure**: The system expects to create session-specific directories but this process is broken

3. **Git Worktree Command Failure**: The git worktree creation command may be failing silently

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

1. Check CLIEnvironmentManager implementation
2. Verify git worktree creation logic
3. Check permissions on worktrees directory
4. Investigate why only persistent folders exist
5. Review session workspace creation flow

## üìù Additional Notes

- The system successfully processes API requests
- Database operations work correctly
- The issue is specifically in workspace/worktree creation
- This affects ALL workflows, not just surgeon
