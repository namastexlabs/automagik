## ðŸ“Š Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas:
1. **SDK Integration**: claude-code-sdk may have inherent concurrency limitations
2. **Database Locks**: High concurrent writes may cause contention
3. **Memory Usage**: Process isolation may increase memory footprint
4. **Performance**: Serialization may impact throughput

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. Work with SDK team to understand limitations
2. Implement database connection pooling and optimization
3. Add memory monitoring and limits
4. Consider horizontal scaling for throughput
