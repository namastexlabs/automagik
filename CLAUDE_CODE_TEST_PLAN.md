# Claude Code Workflow Manual Testing Plan

## üéØ Objective
Manually test the Claude Code workflow system through API endpoints to verify functionality, understand behavior, and validate the integration without using automated scripts.

## üìã Test Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Automagik Agents server running (`make dev` or `AM_FORCE_DEV_ENV=1 uv run python -m src --reload`)
- [ ] Claude CLI installed and authenticated (`~/.claude/.credentials.json` exists)
- [ ] API authentication token available (if auth is enabled)
- [ ] Git repository initialized in workspace
- [ ] Docker daemon running (for Docker mode testing)

### 2. Testing Tools
- **API Client**: Postman, Insomnia, or curl
- **Log Monitoring**: `tail -f logs/server.log` or `make logs FOLLOW=1`
- **Database Client**: For checking session records
- **Git Client**: For verifying commits

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Workflow Health Check

**1.1 Check Available Workflows**
```http
GET http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/workflows
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "workflows": [
    {
      "name": "architect",
      "description": "System design and architecture",
      "has_prompt": true,
      "allowed_tools": ["Read", "Write", "Linear", "Memory"]
    },
    {
      "name": "implement",
      "description": "Feature implementation",
      "has_prompt": true,
      "allowed_tools": ["Task", "Bash", "Edit", "Git", "Memory"]
    },
    // ... other workflows
  ]
}
```

**1.2 Health Check**
```http
GET http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/health
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "mode": "docker", // or "local"
  "claude_cli_available": true,
  "workspace_accessible": true
}
```

### Scenario 2: Simple ARCHITECT Workflow Execution

**2.1 Start ARCHITECT Workflow**
```http
POST http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/architect/run
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Design a simple TODO API with user authentication. Create ARCHITECTURE.md with the design.",
  "max_turns": 20,
  "git_branch": "test-architect-todo-api"
}
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "run_id": "architect-1234567890",
  "workflow": "architect",
  "status": "started",
  "session_id": "session-abc123",
  "started_at": "2025-01-06T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**2.2 Monitor Progress**
```http
GET http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/run/architect-1234567890/status
```

Progressive Status Responses:
```json
// Initial
{
  "run_id": "architect-1234567890",
  "status": "running",
  "progress": {
    "turn": 3,
    "max_turns": 20,
    "last_action": "Creating ARCHITECTURE.md file"
  }
}

// Completed
{
  "run_id": "architect-1234567890",
  "status": "completed",
  "result": {
    "success": true,
    "files_created": ["ARCHITECTURE.md", "DECISIONS.md"],
    "files_modified": [],
    "git_commits": ["feat: design TODO API architecture"],
    "summary": "Designed TODO API with JWT authentication"
  },
  "completed_at": "2025-01-06T10:05:00Z",
  "duration_seconds": 300
}
```

### Scenario 3: IMPLEMENT Workflow with Session Continuity

**3.1 Start IMPLEMENT Using Previous Session**
```http
POST http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/implement/run
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Implement the TODO API based on ARCHITECTURE.md. Focus on the user model and authentication endpoints first.",
  "session_id": "session-abc123",  // Reuse session from ARCHITECT
  "max_turns": 40,
  "git_branch": "test-architect-todo-api"
}
```

**3.2 Real-time Monitoring via Logs**
```bash
# In another terminal
tail -f logs/server.log | grep "claude-code"

# Expected log patterns:
# [INFO] Starting Claude Code workflow: implement
# [INFO] Executor: DockerExecutor
# [INFO] Container ID: claude-code-implement-xyz
# [INFO] Claude action: Reading ARCHITECTURE.md
# [INFO] Claude action: Creating src/models/user.py
# [INFO] Claude action: Running tests
```

### Scenario 4: Error Handling and Recovery

**4.1 Test with Invalid Workflow**
```http
POST http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/invalid-workflow/run
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "This should fail"
}
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "detail": "Workflow 'invalid-workflow' not found"
}
```

**4.2 Test Timeout Behavior**
```http
POST http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/implement/run
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Implement something complex",
  "max_turns": 100,
  "timeout": 60  // Very short timeout
}
```

Monitor for timeout handling in status checks.

### Scenario 5: Complex Multi-Workflow Epic

**5.1 Execute Full Development Cycle**

1. **ARCHITECT Phase**
```http
POST http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/architect/run
{
  "message": "Design a Discord bot integration for automagik-agents. Include async message handling, memory persistence, and rate limiting.",
  "max_turns": 30
}
```

2. **IMPLEMENT Phase** (after ARCHITECT completes)
```http
POST http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/implement/run
{
  "message": "Implement the Discord bot based on ARCHITECTURE.md. Create DiscordAgent extending AutomagikAgent.",
  "session_id": "[from-architect-response]",
  "max_turns": 50
}
```

3. **TEST Phase**
```http
POST http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/test/run
{
  "message": "Create comprehensive tests for the Discord bot implementation. Test async operations, memory integration, and error handling.",
  "session_id": "[same-session]",
  "max_turns": 40
}
```

4. **REVIEW Phase**
```http
POST http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/review/run
{
  "message": "Review the Discord bot implementation for code quality, security, and adherence to automagik-agents patterns.",
  "session_id": "[same-session]",
  "max_turns": 20
}
```

### Scenario 6: Docker vs Local Mode Testing

**6.1 Force Local Mode** (if configured)
```bash
# Set environment variable
export CLAUDE_CODE_MODE=local
# Restart server
```

**6.2 Compare Execution**
Run same workflow in both modes and compare:
- Execution speed
- Resource usage
- File isolation
- Cleanup behavior

### Scenario 7: Memory Integration Testing

**7.1 Workflow with Memory Search**
```http
POST http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/implement/run
{
  "message": "Search memory for Discord integration patterns before implementing. Use any found patterns in the implementation.",
  "max_turns": 30
}
```

Monitor logs for memory tool usage:
```
[INFO] Claude action: Searching memory for "Discord integration patterns"
[INFO] Claude action: Found pattern "async-message-handler"
```

### Scenario 8: Breaking Change Detection

**8.1 Trigger Breaking Change**
```http
POST http://localhost:8881/api/v1/agent/claude-code/refactor/run
{
  "message": "Refactor the API to change all endpoints from /api/v1/ to /api/v2/. Update all references.",
  "max_turns": 30
}
```

Expected: Workflow should detect breaking change and request human approval.
