# Git Worktree Cleanup Implementation Summary

## Implementation Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive automated git worktree cleanup system for Claude Code workflows. This addresses the issue mentioned in the test report where manual deletion of worktree directories left orphaned git references.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Core Cleanup Service
**File**: `src/agents/claude_code/utils/worktree_cleanup.py`
- `WorktreeCleanupService`: Main service class with thread-safe cleanup operations
- Handles cleanup on workflow completion, failure, and cancellation
- Detects and cleans up orphaned worktrees
- Automatically runs `git worktree prune` to clean stale references

### 2. Integration Points

#### a. SDK Execution Strategies
**File**: `src/agents/claude_code/sdk_execution_strategies.py`
- Added cleanup after successful workflow completion (line 433-443)
- Added cleanup after workflow failure (line 315-323)
- Only cleans up non-persistent workspaces

#### b. Process Manager
**File**: `src/agents/claude_code/sdk_process_manager.py`
- Added cleanup when workflows are killed/cancelled (line 102-116)
- Checks workspace persistence before cleanup

#### c. CLI Environment
**File**: `src/agents/claude_code/cli_environment.py`
- Updated cleanup method to use centralized service (line 756-792)
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 3. Periodic Cleanup Script
**File**: `scripts/cleanup_orphaned_worktrees.py`
- Standalone script for scheduled cleanup
- Supports dry-run mode for safety
- Configurable age threshold (default: 48 hours)
- Can be run via cron or scheduled tasks

### 4. Test Script
**File**: `scripts/test_worktree_cleanup.py`
- Simple test to verify cleanup functionality
- Lists current worktrees and identifies orphans

### 5. Documentation
**File**: `docs/worktree-cleanup.md`
- Comprehensive documentation of the cleanup system
- Usage examples and best practices
- Troubleshooting guide

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Cleanup**
   - Non-persistent worktrees cleaned after workflow completion
   - Cleanup on error/failure scenarios
   - Cleanup when workflows are killed

2. **Safety Measures**
   - Never cleans persistent workspaces
   - Skips active workflows
   - Age threshold protection (default: 48h)
   - Dry-run mode for testing

3. **Orphan Detection**
   - Identifies worktrees not associated with active workflows
   - Handles manually deleted directories
   - Runs `git worktree prune` to clean references

4. **Database Integration**
   - Updates `workspace_cleaned_up` flag in workflow_runs table
   - Tracks cleanup status for auditing

## Usage Examples

### Manual Cleanup
```bash
# Dry run to see what would be cleaned
python scripts/cleanup_orphaned_worktrees.py --dry-run

# Clean up worktrees older than 24 hours
python scripts/cleanup_orphaned_worktrees.py --max-age-hours=24
```

### Programmatic Cleanup
```python
from src.agents.claude_code.utils.worktree_cleanup import cleanup_workflow_worktree

# Clean up specific workflow
await cleanup_workflow_worktree(run_id="abc-123")

# Clean up orphans
await cleanup_orphaned_worktrees(max_age_hours=48)
```

### Scheduled Cleanup (Cron)
```bash
# Daily cleanup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /path/to/python /path/to/scripts/cleanup_orphaned_worktrees.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Disk Space Issues**
   - Automatically removes temporary worktrees
   - Reclaims disk space from completed workflows

2. **Handles Edge Cases**
   - Cleans up after manual directory deletion
   - Prunes stale git references
   - Handles interrupted workflows

3. **Flexible Configuration**
   - Configurable age thresholds
   - Persistent workspace support
   - Dry-run mode for safety

4. **Production Ready**
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Detailed logging

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run the test script to verify functionality:
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_worktree_cleanup.py
   ```

2. Test cleanup in dry-run mode first:
   ```bash
   python scripts/cleanup_orphaned_worktrees.py --dry-run --verbose
   ```

3. Monitor cleanup operations in logs:
   ```bash
   grep "worktree cleanup" logs/claude_code.log
   ```

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The cleanup system will help maintain a clean workspace environment and prevent accumulation of orphaned worktrees.
