## 🛠️ Tech Stack Detection

**The automagik-genie-analyzer agent will automatically detect:**
- Programming languages (Go, Rust, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)
- Frameworks (React, Vue, Django, FastAPI, Spring Boot, Gin, etc.)
- Build systems (Maven, Gradle, Cargo, Go modules, npm/yarn, etc.)
- Testing frameworks (Jest, pytest, Go test, Cargo test, etc.)
- Quality tools (ESLint, Ruff, rustfmt, gofmt, etc.)

**No manual configuration needed** - the analyzer handles tech stack adaptation!

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### Memory-First Development Protocol
**Before ANY development task:**
1. **Search Memory**: Use automagik-genie-analyzer to search for existing patterns and preferences
2. **Create Task Files**: Document objectives in `genie/active/` before starting work
3. **Branch Strategy**: Create new branch for each epic (`git checkout -b epic/feature-name`)
4. **Execute & Commit**: Work in subtasks, commit frequently with co-authorship
5. **Ask Permission**: Request approval before pushing to remote

### First Steps
1. **Analyze your codebase**: `/wish "analyze this codebase"`
2. **Search Memory**: Look for existing patterns using analyzer before starting
3. **Get tech-stack-specific recommendations**: Analyzer will provide language/framework-specific guidance
4. **Start development**: Use detected patterns and tools for optimal development experience

### Available Hooks (Working Examples!)
- **TDD Guard**: Real TDD workflow enforcement with multi-language support
- **Quality Automation**: Pre-commit validation with auto-detected tech stack tools
- **Ready to Use**: Copy templates, make executable, customize for automagik

## 💻 Environment Setup & Essential Commands

<environment_setup>
### Essential Commands
```bash
# Environment setup (ALWAYS activate first)
source .venv/bin/activate  # MANDATORY before any Python work
uv sync                    # Install dependencies
uv add package-name        # Add new dependency (NEVER use pip)
uv run python script.py    # Run Python scripts

# Development
make install              # Setup environment
make dev                  # Start development server
make status               # Check service status
make logs-f               # Follow logs real-time
make health               # Health check services

# Database
make db-init              # Initialize database
make db-migrate           # Run migrations

# Quality (95%+ coverage required)
make test                 # Run tests
make lint                 # Code linting (ruff)
make format               # Format code
```
</environment_setup>

## 📚 Getting Started

Run your first wish to let the analyzer understand your project:
```
/wish "analyze this codebase and provide development recommendations"
```

The analyzer will auto-detect your tech stack and provide customized guidance!

## 🔄 Git Workflow & Task Orchestration

<git_workflow>
### Git Operations - Commit Often, Ask Before Push
**Branch Strategy:**
- Create new branch for each epic: `git checkout -b epic/authentication-system`
- Never work directly on main branch
- One epic = One branch

**Commit Pattern:**
- Commit after completing each subtask
- Use clear, descriptive messages
- Always include Genie co-authorship:
  ```
  git commit -m "feat: add auth models" -m "Co-Authored-By: Automagik Genie <genie@namastex.ai>"
  ```

**Push Protocol:**
- **ASK PERMISSION** before pushing: "Ready to push changes to remote. Should I proceed?"
- Create PR with `gh pr create` when epic is complete
- Let user control when changes go to remote
</git_workflow>

<task_orchestration>
### Genie Task File Structure
```
genie/
├── active/          # Current work (MAX 5 files)
├── completed/       # Done work (YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md)
└── reference/       # Important docs to keep
```

**Task File Template:**
```markdown
# Task: [Specific Task Name]
## Objective
[Single, clear purpose]
## Instructions
[Precise, numbered steps - no ambiguity]
## Completion Criteria
[Clear definition of done]
## Dependencies
[Required files, APIs, prior tasks]
```

**Naming Conventions:**
- Tasks: `task-[component].md`
- Epics: `epic-[name].md`
- Analysis: `analysis-[topic].md`
- Plans: `plan-[feature].md`
</task_orchestration>

## 🛡️ Quality Standards & Security

<security_requirements>
### Security Patterns
- API authentication on ALL `/api/v1/` endpoints
- Input validation with Pydantic models
- No secrets in code or commits
- Use `.env` files for configuration
- JWT RS256 for authentication
</security_requirements>

<testing_standards>
### Testing Requirements
- **95%+ test coverage** (mandatory)
- Unit tests for all utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for workflows
- Memory pattern validation tests
```bash
pytest tests/                    # Run all tests
pytest tests/agents/ -v          # Verbose agent tests
pytest --cov=automagik --cov-report=html  # Coverage report
```
</testing_standards>

<performance_patterns>
### Performance Optimization
- Async operations for I/O
- Connection pooling for databases
- Proper resource cleanup
- Batch operations where possible
- Memory-efficient data processing
</performance_patterns>
